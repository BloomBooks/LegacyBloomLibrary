        <div class="termsSub">Notice and Takedown Procedure</div>
        <div class="termsItem">
            It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the
            United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
            This page describes the information that should be present in these notices.
            It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to the Bloom Library as straightforward
            as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.
            The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which
            can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov),
            but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.
        </div>
        <div class="termsItem">
            It is expected that all users of any part of the Bloom Library site will comply with applicable copyright laws.
            However, if the Bloom Library receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response
            to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing
            activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under
            United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.
        </div>
        <div class="termsItem">
            If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the
            owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant
            to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
